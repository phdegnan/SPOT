# SPOT
sRNA-target Prediction Organizing Tool 

Rationale
Computational approaches for sRNA target prediction have limitations but
are relied upon to generate testable hypotheses for sRNA function. Some
algorithms are available online or downloadable (e.g., TargetRNA2,
IntaRNA), however these tools frequently yield distinct results, have
different data output formats and default search parameters. Therefore,
manually compiling results from these disparate tools and integrating
the predictions with existing experimental data is not trivial. We have
generated an innovative approach to streamline use of multiple existing
sRNA target prediction algorithms and integrate predictions with
experimental data to generate a unified set of target predictions. To
this end, we have developed SPOT a flexible software pipeline that
searches for sRNA-mRNA binding sites in parallel using separate search
tools, collates the predictions, and integrates experimental data using
customizable results filters.
